        <h3>WRITTEN WITH LOVE!! ❤️</h3>
        
        <h4>FAVOURITE MOMENTS ✨</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting you. 🥰</li>
            <li>Going on the nail date with you was the best thing ever. I'm so glad I didn’t cancel. 💅</li>
            <li>When I forgot my keys, and you gave me your M-Pesa and phone PIN to buy lunch—it’s how you didn’t hesitate! 💖</li>
            <li>Every time you brought me sweets, bought me chocolates, and got me lunch. 🍫🍬</li>
            <li>Every time you drove to Utawala just to take me home. 🚗💨</li>
            <li>Every time you kissed me on the forehead when you hugged me. 😘</li>
            <li>I loved going for walks with you. 🚶‍♀️</li>
            <li>My 25th birthday was the BEST because of you. 🎂🎉</li>
            <li>When you told me my feelings matter to you, no matter how small or petty they might seem. 💞</li>
            <li>You probably don’t know, but every time we argue, my heart breaks a little. But you make it better by reassuring, affirming, hugging, and kissing me. You make me feel safe and sure that we will be okay. 🫂💖</li>
            <li>You came all the way to Westlands for me, even though you were angry and don’t like hospitals. 🏥</li>
            <li>Drinking together. 🍷</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. 🥹💍</li>
            <li>Every single moment we have spent together—watching movies, cooking, doing chores, arguing—has been the best because it was with you. ❤️</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>WORST MOMENTS 💔</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When you want to leave before we sort things out in the middle of an argument because you feel like I don’t understand you. It makes me feel weak. 🥺</li>
            <li>Every time I complained about other girls. 😞</li>
            <li>When I found out about you and Pauline. 💔</li>
            <li>Every time we argue. 😢</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I just hope we never lose love and respect for each other. 💕</p>
        <p>I hope we never stop caring for each other. 🤞</p>
        <p>I hope we can get past the argument phase and just enjoy each other’s company & our relationship. 🥰</p>
        <p>I hope things work out for us. 🙏</p>

        <h3>To My Ride or Die ❤️</h3>
        <p>You are not just my girl, you became the reason why I work hard every day. 💪</p>
        <p>In a world full of noise, you are my peace. ☮️ With you, I feel free. 🕊️</p>
        <p>I say I live life in the moment, but with you, I've learned to live in the moment and also think about the consequences.</p>
        <p>I may not be able to tell you this every day, but I just want to let you know that you mean the world to me. 🌍</p>
        <p>Thank you for being there when no one else was. 🤗</p>
        <p>Thank you for all the late-night conversations, the phone calls, the TikToks. 📱😂</p>
        <p>You've given me a feeling I haven't had in a long time, and for that, I just want you to know—I'll be HERE. 💖</p>
        <p>For the past six months, we've gotten to know each other—our flaws and our beauties.</p>
        <h4>Last Year, What I Never Liked:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Not being able to talk to me so I can help. 🗣️</li>
            <li>Always taking the blame, even when I was just commenting. 🤦‍♂️</li>
            <li>Not letting me talk. 🤐</li>
            <li>Being close-minded and stubborn to change. 💭</li>
            <li>Not following the 7 rules!! ⚖️</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>But We Grew Together... 💕</h4>
        <p>Communication improved. 📞</p>
        <p>Open to dialogue. 🗨️</p>
        <p>Still working on letting one talk. 💬</p>
        <p>Trying to explain the reasons behind actions. 🤔</p>
        <h4>Our Goals for the Future: 🚀</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding 🤝</li>
            <li>Vulnerability 💞</li>
            <li>Teamwork 👥</li>
            <li>Harmony 🎵</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It won't always be easy, and we may argue, but we WON'T STOP TRYING. 💖</p>
        <p>Thank you for picking me up when I'm low. Thank you for holding me when I cried. Thank you for every moment, good and bad. 🙏</p>
        <h3>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! ❤️</h3>
        <p>I am sorry if I ever made you feel unloved. 😞</p>
        <p>I am sorry for every mistake, every tear, every negative emotion. 💔</p>
        <p>I am trying to be better for you, even when I fail. 🔄</p>
        <p>All I ask is one thing:</p>
        <h2>Just Please... Don't Give Up On Me. 🙏</h2>
        <p>Eventually, I will be better. Not perfect... but better. 💖</p>
